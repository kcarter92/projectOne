# Aller-Jeeves
**GETTING STARTED**:
The program should run automatically.

If the program is not running automatically, please make sure you have all the prerequisites listed below.

**STATEMENT OF PURPOSE**:
Aller-Jeeves is a food application for people who have dietary and or allergy restrictions and still want to enjoy making food.

Aller-Jeeves was created to showcases the use of APIs from Yummly and Neutrino by pulling AJAX requests to create Aller-Jeeves. Learning to use JavaScript Animation, Anime Js, and deploying from Firebase Database. Aller-Jeeves is a group effort to provide a polished UI and specific seach options for the user.

Aller-Jeeves contains recipe cards which contains the recipes, a picture of the recipe, and a book marking options (when the user logs in) on the front of the card. When the user clicks on the recipe the card flips over to the back side to display ingredient list and a link to the recipe.

**PREREQUISITES**:
- Google Chrome Internet Browser
- jQuery enabled on Google Chrome
- JavaScript Animation
- JavaScript enabled on Google Chrome
- Access to Google Font packages
- Access to Yummly and Neutrino API

**HOW TO PLAY**:
Once pages loads, the user will input a search for a specific recipe or ingredient and will have an option to narrow down the search based on allergy and or dietary restrictions.

The page will load  the front of the recipe cards with the name of the recipe, the image of the recipe, and a bookmarking option once the user logs in. Once the user clicks on the front of the recipe card, the card will flip to the back displaying an ingredient list and a link to the recipe.

If the user wants to look for a new search, there is a search input followed by a drop down for the restrictions, and a submission button to create a new search.
